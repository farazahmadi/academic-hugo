The goal of this project was to understand the segments that are struggling with their health and
wellness as a result of the pandemic, and the types (or themes) of struggles they are facing or main areas of concern in order to recommend the types of supplemental services or partnerships.

The project was proposed by RBC Insurance as the final project for the MBA course I was taking in Fall 2020. In this project I practiced team-work in a full scale data science project. A wide range of analytical methods were use to produce knowledge from both data sets.

Two different data sets were used in this analysis. [CAMH](https://www.delvinia.com/camh-coronavirus-mental-health/) by Delvinia and the geo-demographic data from [Environics Analytics](https://environicsanalytics.com/en-ca). We were given access to the latter, only for this course and project and that is why I am not sharing the report or code here. They both can be shared (without the rough data set) upon request.


The work here was the final group project for _M733 Marketing Analytics_ MBA course that I took in 2020.
