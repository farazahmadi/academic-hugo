This work is a preliminary data analysis task done on a survey data set done on ice cream brands. Its purpose is to clean and prepare the data set using different packages in R so that it can be used most easily by the analysts. This data set accompanies the __“Seven Summits of Marketing Research”__ text by Greg Allenby and Jeff Brazell. This was my first assignment for the Marketing Analysis course I had in fall 2020.

The [report](/proj/assign2.html) is produced using *Rstudio* as an HTML file. You can find the code on my [github page](https://github.com/farazahmadi/Icecream-survey-cleaning).
