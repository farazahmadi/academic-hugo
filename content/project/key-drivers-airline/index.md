This is a comprehensive predictive analytics project, in which I clean and prepare the raw survey data for the analysis. Do exploratory analysis around customer's responses, check for multicollinearity among questions in the survey and then use Logistic Regression in [H2O](https://www.h2o.ai/) to create a predictive model and identify the key drivers of return, an insight which could be used for making marketing decisions.

The [report](/proj/assign2.html) is produced using *Rstudio* as an HTML file. You can find the code on my [github page](https://github.com/farazahmadi/key-drivers-airline).
