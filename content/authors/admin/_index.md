As a second-year master's student, I am interested in data science and translating data into valuable information. Whether using complex neural network models or a simple linear regression, I build predictive models and apply clustering/ segmentation methods to the observations. My goal is to use analytical tools to help with more informed/data-driven decision makings.

Currently, for my research, I apply data analytics and ML methods to healthcare data sets. Here, I will showcase some of my projects to display my abilities as a data scientist.
